"""Compute a GO / NO-GO reliability verdict for a quality rubric from held-out cold-judge scores.

Reliability (not validity) is what this checks: do independent judges, who never saw the
rubric being tuned, land on the same answer on briefings the rubric was never tuned against.
A rubric that passes here is safe to use as a regression GATE for prompt changes. It does NOT
establish that the scores match true human quality — that needs an external referent.

Input: a TSV with columns  uuid_short  batch  judgeA  judgeB
  - integer totals (0-30) for graded briefings
  - the literal "DQ" when a judge disqualified the briefing at a gate
    (gate-named variants like "DQ-faithfulness" are normalized to "DQ")
Blank lines and #-comments are ignored; ONE other non-data line (an uncommented
header) is tolerated with a stderr warning. Any further unparseable line is data
loss: the script reports it on stderr and exits 2 without computing a verdict.

GO criteria (all must hold):
  - no faithfulness/gate disagreement that isn't a clean DQ-vs-DQ agreement
  - every disqualified briefing is disqualified by BOTH judges (gate decisions are reproducible)
  - max inter-judge spread on graded briefings <= MAX_SPREAD
  - zero "blowouts" (graded spread >= BLOWOUT)

Usage:  uv run scripts/python/rubric_verdict.py experiment-evals/<exp>/rubric_scores.tsv
