"""Tests for rubric_verdict — TSV parsing, GO/NO-GO derivation, and main() exit codes.

Parser contract (load): hash-comments and blank lines are free; gate-named DQ
verdicts ("DQ-faithfulness") normalize to "DQ"; every OTHER skipped line is
counted and returned as `(rows, skipped)` so main() can refuse to gate on a
silently-shrunken sample (one uncommented header line is tolerated).

Regression history:
- cold-judge runs wrote `scores.tsv` with an uncommented header and the verdict
  crashed on `int('judgeA')` — headers/non-data rows must be skipped.
- judges emit "DQ-faithfulness"-style verdicts; dropping those rows hid 1-of-2
  gate splits and produced a FALSE GO.

DELIBERATE CONTRACT CHANGE (silent-row-loss fix): load() returns
`(rows, skipped)` instead of bare `rows`. The pre-existing load tests below
were updated to unpack the tuple; their row-content assertions are unchanged.
