# /release-prep

Open the omni monorepo's `develop → qa` PR, wait for its checks, merge it, then open the `qa → master` PR — the pending production release. Compile and print a `#devs-only` message that groups every included PR under its author so the team can confirm before the actual release.

omni is one monorepo (`develop → qa → master`, mapping to `dev / qa / prod`), so a release prep is a single repo's branch promotion — there is no per-repo loop.

## Prerequisites

**books/.env variables**: `$RELEASE_OMNI_DIR`, `$RELEASE_AUTHOR_MAP`, `$RELEASE_DEVS_CHANNEL`, `$CLICKUP_TEAM_ID`, `$RELEASE_CLICKUP_TICKET_BASE`
**scripts/.env variables**: none — this command builds ClickUp ticket links from the custom id (no API call); `CLICKUP_API_KEY` is not required here.
**Tools**: `gh` (authenticated), `git`, `jq`

Defaults if a `books/.env` value is unset: `$RELEASE_OMNI_DIR=$HOME/Documents/gp/dev/omni`, `$RELEASE_AUTHOR_MAP=$HOME/.claude/release-authors.json`, `$RELEASE_DEVS_CHANNEL=#devs-only`, `$RELEASE_CLICKUP_TICKET_BASE=https://goodparty.clickup.com/t/$CLICKUP_TEAM_ID`.

**Never commit on the user's behalf.** This command opens and merges PRs through `gh pr merge` (which acts on the remote), but never runs `git commit` locally.

## Steps

This command takes no arguments — the release target is always the omni monorepo.

### Phase 1: Resolve repo and config

1. **Resolve the omni repo path** per the `resolve-omni-dir` block above. Confirm it back to the user before continuing:

   > Will run release prep for omni (`<path>`). OK?

2. **Load the author map.** Read `$RELEASE_AUTHOR_MAP` if it exists — JSON of GitHub login → Slack display name:

   ```json
   {
     "bryan-mcdonell": "Bryan",
     "feliks-goodparty": "Feliks",
     "daniel-x": "Daniel",
     "sanjay-y": "Sanjay"
   }
   ```

   If the file doesn't exist, warn the user that unmapped authors will appear as raw GitHub logins in the message, then continue.

### Phase 2: develop → qa

3. **Fetch and check the diff:**

   ```bash
   cd "$RELEASE_OMNI_DIR"
   git fetch origin --prune
   git log origin/qa..origin/develop --oneline --no-merges
   ```

   If output is empty, print `omni: no changes between qa and develop — nothing to release`, and stop here (skip to the step 16 final report). There is nothing to prep.

4. **Create (or reuse) the develop → qa PR.** This command is rerunnable; check for an existing open PR first to avoid `gh pr create`'s 422 on duplicates:

   ```bash
   cd "$RELEASE_OMNI_DIR"
   gh pr list --base qa --head develop --state open --json number,url
   ```

   If the result is non-empty, capture the existing PR number and skip the create. Otherwise build the body inline with `mktemp` and create:

   ```bash
   cd "$RELEASE_OMNI_DIR"
   BODY_FILE=$(mktemp)
   printf '## Included PRs\n\n' > "$BODY_FILE"
   git log origin/qa..origin/develop --oneline --no-merges | sed 's/^/- /' >> "$BODY_FILE"
   gh pr create \
     --base qa --head develop \
     --title "Release prep: develop → qa ($(date +%F))" \
     --body-file "$BODY_FILE"
   rm -f "$BODY_FILE"
   ```

   Capture the PR number from `gh`'s output. `gh` reads the owner/repo from the cwd's git remote — no `--repo` flag needed when `cd`'d into the omni repo. **Each code block re-runs the `cd` defensively** — some agent runtimes reset cwd between tool calls, so don't rely on a single `cd` carrying across separate blocks.

5. **Wait for the PR's checks to settle:**

   ```bash
   cd "$RELEASE_OMNI_DIR"
   gh pr checks <pr_number> --watch
   ```

   This blocks until the checks reach a terminal state. If any check is in `FAIL` / `CANCEL` / `TIMEOUT`, pause and present three options:

   > omni PR #<n>: <which> check(s) failed.
   >
   > - **`retry`** — re-trigger CI (re-run failed jobs from the GitHub UI, or push a no-op) and re-watch
   > - **`merge-anyway`** — flaky test or known-good; merge it despite the red
   > - **`abort`** — stop the release prep; nothing gets merged

   Record the outcome (`green` / `merge-anyway`). For a `merge-anyway`, also record the names of the checks that were in `FAIL` / `CANCEL` / `TIMEOUT` state — the step 16 final report needs them. On `abort`, stop here and skip the rest of the run — Phase 3 and Phase 4 both assume the merge happened, and Phase 4 in particular would build the `#devs-only` message from stale `master..qa` state. Jump straight to the step 16 final report, which records the left-open develop→qa PR (and whether its checks had already settled before the abort) so it can be merged manually or by re-running the command.

6. **Merge the develop → qa PR with a merge commit** (unless step 5 ended in `abort` — then skip this entire step; the abort guarantee is that nothing gets merged):

   ```bash
   cd "$RELEASE_OMNI_DIR"
   gh pr merge <pr_number> --merge
   ```

   If `gh pr merge` fails (non-zero exit), **stop here** — do not proceed to step 7 or 8. Phase 3 and Phase 4 both assume the develop→qa merge landed; running them against a failed merge opens a `qa → master` PR with no new content. Report the error and point the user to the Troubleshooting table below, then skip to the step 16 final report.

   `--merge` (not `--squash`) is intentional — it preserves the included PRs' squash commits on `qa` and `master`, which is what `/release` parses to build the release notes.

7. **Re-fetch** so local `qa` is current:

   ```bash
   cd "$RELEASE_OMNI_DIR"
   git fetch origin --prune
   ```

### Phase 3: qa → master (pending release)

8. **Open the `qa → master` PR — but do not merge it** (skip this entire step if step 5 ended in `abort`, or if step 6's merge failed — in either case nothing was merged, so there is no new state to release). This is the pending production release. First check for an existing open one (same rerunnability concern as step 4):

   ```bash
   cd "$RELEASE_OMNI_DIR"
   gh pr list --base master --head qa --state open --json number,url
   ```

   If non-empty, reuse the existing PR. Otherwise build the body inline and create:

   ```bash
   cd "$RELEASE_OMNI_DIR"
   BODY_FILE=$(mktemp)
   printf '## Included PRs (qa → master)\n\n' > "$BODY_FILE"
   git log origin/master..origin/qa --oneline --no-merges | sed 's/^/- /' >> "$BODY_FILE"
   gh pr create \
     --base master --head qa \
     --title "Release: qa → master ($(date +%F))" \
     --body-file "$BODY_FILE"
   rm -f "$BODY_FILE"
   ```

   Capture the PR's URL. Same `cd`-per-block discipline as step 4.

### Phase 4: Build the #devs-only message

> **Skip this entire phase and step 15 if Phase 2 was aborted, if step 6's merge failed, or if there was nothing to merge.** Nothing was merged this run, so there is nothing to announce — `git log origin/master..origin/qa` would only surface stale commits from a prior cycle, and printing an empty announcement message is misleading. Go to the step 16 final report instead.

9. **List the commits being released** — these are the squash commits between `master` and `qa`. Capture the hash too, since not every subject ends with `(#<n>)`:

   ```bash
   cd "$RELEASE_OMNI_DIR"
   git log origin/master..origin/qa --no-merges --pretty=format:'%H %s'
   ```

   For each line, try the regex `\(#(\d+)\)$` on the subject. If it matches, you have the PR number. If it doesn't (older PRs, direct pushes, non-standard merge messages), recover the PR by commit hash via the commit-to-PRs association API:

   ```bash
   cd "$RELEASE_OMNI_DIR"
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/<commit_hash>/pulls \
     --jq '.[0] | {number, title, author: .user.login, body, branch: .head.ref}'
   ```

   Capture `branch` (the PR's head branch) too — it's a primary source for the ENG-XXXX tag in step 11. Use the commits-to-pulls endpoint, **not** `gh pr list --search '<hash>'` — `--search` is free-text against PR title/body/comments, so a bare hash only matches if someone manually pasted it into the PR text. The `commits/{sha}/pulls` endpoint uses the commit graph, which is what we actually want. `gh api` substitutes `{owner}` and `{repo}` from the cwd's git remote — that's why the defensive `cd` matters here.

   If the endpoint returns an empty array (e.g., a direct push to develop with no PR ever opened), keep the commit as a "no-PR" entry — fall back to `%s` (subject) for the title. For the author, do **not** use `git log --pretty='%an'`: that returns the git-configured name (`Bryan McDonell`), but `$RELEASE_AUTHOR_MAP` is keyed on GitHub logins (`bryan-mcdonell`), so the lookup would always miss and the unmapped-authors report would surface a git name the user can't add to the map. Fetch the GitHub login instead:

   ```bash
   cd "$RELEASE_OMNI_DIR"
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/<commit_hash> --jq '.author.login'
   ```

   If `.author.login` is `null` (the commit's git email isn't linked to any GitHub account), fall back to `git log -1 --pretty=format:'%ae' <commit_hash>` (the email) as a last resort. Mark either case in the final report so the user knows there's a commit without a clean GitHub-login attribution.

10. **Fetch each PR's metadata** for the matched-by-regex cases (the hash-search cases above already returned metadata in the search response, so skip them here):

    ```bash
    cd "$RELEASE_OMNI_DIR"
    gh pr view <pr_number> --json number,title,author,body,headRefName
    ```

    Capture `number`, `title`, `author.login`, `body`, and `headRefName` (the branch — a primary ENG-tag source).

11. **Extract ENG-XXXX tags for each PR.** Scan the regex `ENG-\d+` (case-insensitive, uppercase the results, dedupe) across the **union of four sources**, not just title/body:
    - PR `title`
    - PR `body`
    - PR head branch name (`headRefName` / `branch` from step 9–10)
    - the subjects of every commit in `master..qa` that maps to this PR (you already have these from step 9's `git log`)

    **Title/body alone is not enough** — in practice the ticket id most often lives only in the branch name (`ENG-10256-persist-primary-result`) or a commit subject (`chore: ENG-10253 overflow`), while the PR title is a generic summary with no tag. Scanning only title/body silently drops the ticket for the majority of PRs. A PR may legitimately yield **zero** tags (a chore/refactor with no ticket anywhere) or **more than one** (e.g., a PR that closed `ENG-10245` and `ENG-10246`) — both are fine.

    Example, per commit, accumulating tags into the PR keyed by `<pr_number>`:

    ```bash
    cd "$RELEASE_OMNI_DIR"
    subj=$(git log -1 --pretty=%s "<commit_hash>")
    gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/<commit_hash>/pulls | jq -r --arg subj "$subj" '
      (.[0] // empty)
      | ([.title, (.body // ""), (.head.ref // ""), $subj] | join(" ")
         | [scan("ENG-[0-9]+"; "i")] | map(ascii_upcase) | unique | join(","))'
    ```

12. **Build a ClickUp ticket link for each ENG-XXXX tag.** No API call is needed — ClickUp resolves the custom-id URL directly:

    ```
    $RELEASE_CLICKUP_TICKET_BASE/<ENG-XXXX>
    ```

    where `$RELEASE_CLICKUP_TICKET_BASE` defaults to `https://goodparty.clickup.com/t/$CLICKUP_TEAM_ID` (workspace subdomain `goodparty`, team id from `$CLICKUP_TEAM_ID`). A tag `ENG-7506` becomes `https://goodparty.clickup.com/t/90132012119/ENG-7506`.

    Do **not** call `clickup_api.py` here — message 1 shows the PR title plus the ticket link, not the ticket's ClickUp title. (Fetching the ticket title is `/release`'s job for the `#product-releases` notes in message 2.) These links are paste-safe: pasted into Slack as raw URLs they auto-link.

13. **Group PRs by author** using the map loaded in step 2:
    - `author.login` → Slack display name via the JSON map
    - Unmapped logins → use the raw login as-is, surface in the final report

14. **Format the message** to match the exact layout used in `$RELEASE_DEVS_CHANNEL`:

    ```
    Here are the changes that are included in today's pending production release.

    If you're tagged in this message, please confirm that your changes are ready to go to prod by leaving a :white_check_mark: reaction on this message.

    @<Slack name>:
      •  #<pr_number>: <pr_title> <ticket_link> [<ticket_link2> ...]
      •  ...

    @<Slack name>:
      •  ...
    ```

    Each PR line ends with the ClickUp ticket link(s) from step 12 — one per ENG-XXXX tag, space-separated. A PR with no ENG tag (chore/refactor) gets no link, just the title. Example lines:

    ```
      •  #1704: feat: update domain registrant to a vercel owner https://goodparty.clickup.com/t/90132012119/ENG-7506
      •  #1913: fix(TextComplianceStep): update styling ... https://goodparty.clickup.com/t/90132012119/ENG-10245 https://goodparty.clickup.com/t/90132012119/ENG-10246
      •  #1895: fix: rename useVerisons -> useVersions and add error handling
    ```

    Ordering: authors in the order they first appear in the diff (oldest merged PR's author first); PRs/commits under each author in merge order. Leave any ENG-XXXX already present in the PR title as-is — don't strip it; the appended link is the canonical reference.

    For step-9 no-PR fallback entries (direct pushes, missing search match), use `<commit_hash[:7]>: <subject>` in place of `#<n>: <title>`; still scan the commit subject for an ENG tag and append its link if found. The user can decide whether to keep or strip these before pasting.

### Phase 5: Print and report

15. **Print the formatted message** between visible delimiters so it's easy to copy:

    ```
    ──────── COPY BELOW INTO #devs-only ────────
    Here are the changes that are included in today's pending production release.
    ...
    ──────── END ────────
    ```

16. **Final report:**
    - If merged clean (`green`): develop→qa merged, qa→master PR opened — with the open `qa → master` PR URL
    - If merged despite red checks (`merge-anyway`): same as above, but call out which check(s) were red and overridden, so the team confirming in `$RELEASE_DEVS_CHANNEL` knows they shipped with a known failure
    - If there were no changes between qa and develop: note it and stop (no PRs opened)
    - If Phase 2 was aborted or the step-6 merge failed: nothing was merged, so re-run or merge manually to continue. Note the state of the left-open develop→qa PR:
      - if its checks had already settled `green` before the abort: list with URL and note "checks already settled — merge manually, or re-run the command (re-watching settled checks is near-instant)"
      - if checks settled with failures before the abort: list with URL and note "checks failed — do not merge without investigating the failures or applying a fix first"
      - if its checks were still running when aborted: list with URL and note "CI may still be running — watch before merging"
    - Any unmapped GitHub authors that fell back to raw logins (suggest adding them to `$RELEASE_AUTHOR_MAP`)
    - Any PRs with no ENG-XXXX tag found in title/body/branch/commits (rendered with no ticket link) — flag so the user can add a ticket reference if one was expected
    - Any commits with no PR backing them (no `(#<n>)` suffix and `gh api .../commits/<hash>/pulls` returned `[]`) — these appeared in the message with a commit-hash placeholder
    - Suggested next step: "After the team has confirmed (:white_check_mark: reactions in `$RELEASE_DEVS_CHANNEL`), run `/release` to merge qa → master and post the release notes."

## Important Notes

- **One repo: omni.** It's a monorepo — `develop → qa → master`. There is no per-repo loop and no repo-list argument.
- **Do not commit on the user's behalf.** All merges run through `gh pr merge` (acts on the remote PR). Never `git commit` locally.
- **`--merge`, not `--squash`.** The merge style is load-bearing — `/release` parses the `qa..master` diff to find included ENG-XXXX tags. Squashing would collapse them into the parent PR's commit body, making the lookup more fragile.
- **Skip silent on empty diff.** If `git log qa..develop` is empty, that's normal — note it in the final report and stop.
- **Don't merge the qa → master PR.** This command only opens it. The actual release merge is done by `/release` once the team has confirmed.
- **`gh` cwd detection.** When `cd`'d into the omni repo, `gh` resolves owner/repo from the git remote. Don't pass `--repo`.

## Troubleshooting

| Failure | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `gh pr create` returns "no commits between qa and develop" | Step 3 should have caught this — re-run step 3 to confirm the diff is empty, then stop. |
| `gh pr checks --watch` hangs | CI may never have started. Check the PR's Checks tab in the GitHub UI. Cancel with Ctrl-C; use `merge-anyway` if you know the build is healthy. |
| A PR you expected to have a ticket shows no link | No `ENG-\d+` was found in its title, body, branch name, or any of its commit subjects. Either the ticket was never referenced (add it to the PR/branch and re-run) or it's a genuine no-ticket chore. The link is built from the custom id — there's no API call to fail here. |
| Ticket link 404s when clicked | `$RELEASE_CLICKUP_TICKET_BASE` is wrong, or `$CLICKUP_TEAM_ID` doesn't match the workspace. The canonical form is `https://<workspace>.clickup.com/t/<team_id>/<ENG-XXXX>`. Fix the var; no re-fetch needed. |
| Two PRs reference the same ENG ticket | Expected (e.g., a gp-webapp and a gp-api package change for the same feature, now in one repo). The dev-only message lists both PRs under their respective authors; the ticket is not deduped here — that's `/release`'s job. |
| Author appears as raw GitHub login | They're not in `$RELEASE_AUTHOR_MAP`. Add them to the JSON and re-run, or edit the printed message before pasting. |
| `gh pr merge --merge` fails with "Pull request is not mergeable" | Branch protection rule (e.g., required review) is in effect. Resolve in the GitHub UI, then re-run from step 6. |
| `gh api .../commits/<hash>/pulls` returns `[]` for a commit | No PR was ever opened for that commit (likely a direct push to develop). Step 9's no-PR fallback should have caught this — the entry will appear in the dev-only message with a commit-hash placeholder, and is surfaced in the final report. |
